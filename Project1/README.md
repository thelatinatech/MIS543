Goal: the <i>input_numbers.py</i> should:

1. Accept an integer from the user
2. If user inputs any invalid datatypes (other than integer) display error message and prompt for input again.
3. Write the number to a new line in a file named "numbers.txt" in the same folder as "input_numbers.py"
4. Ask if the user wants to continue, then Yes/No
5. If user inputs 'Yes', repeat steps 1- 4 until user inputs 'No'.
